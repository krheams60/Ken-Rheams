### Annual income World wide
This project consist of annual income for individuals that were surveyed in different countries
all over the world. Their income consisted of either making $50,000 or less and those who were
making over $50,000 annually. Different factors were used for this project including their age,
occupation, education, gender and what their native country is. The overall gap in their incomes
showed more are making the higher income in Industrialized nations than those living in what is\
considered non Industrialized nations.

I would recommend that International corporations and sponsers invest more spending and education in
those regions throughout the world that have less annual income and access to those type of services.
